# autoSSH-autoSetup
Automate Reverse SSH setup for remote hosts

The issue - you want to be able to access new hosts behind a firewall

(especially useful for those set up on remote sites)

The solution - have the new hosts phone home upon boot

(& leave a host connection shortcut)

Includes -

[Find Open Port](findopenport) script

[Reverse SSH](reverseSSH.sh) script

[Reverse Zabbix](reverseZabbix.sh) script

[Report](report.sh) script
